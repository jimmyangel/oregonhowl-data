## oregonhowl-data

This repo is used to generate [OregonHOWL](https://oregonhowl.org/) data that needs to be updated periodically. Currently it is limited to data in support of the Recent Wildfires spotlight, which needs to be regenerated regularly.

`npm install` - Install dev dependencies (e.g., getGeoMAC)

`npm run build` - Regenerates the data onto `public` directory
